ANN stands for Artificial Neural Network. It is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. ANNs consist of interconnected groups of artificial neurons, which process information using a connectionist approach to computation. They are used to model complex patterns and prediction problems in various fields such as machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining.

Here is a brief explanation of the components of an ANN:

1. **Input Layer**: The layer that receives the input data.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Layers between the input and output layers where the computation is performed through weighted connections.
3. **Output Layer**: The layer that produces the final output of the network.
4. **Neurons**: Basic units of the network that perform computations.
5. **Weights**: Parameters that determine the strength of the connections between neurons.
6. **Activation Function**: A function applied to the output of each neuron to introduce non-linearity into the model.

ANNs are widely used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.
